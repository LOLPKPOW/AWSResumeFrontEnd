# AWSResumeFrontEnd
###### This is a repo created for resume.pwoodward.info
###### It's for the front-end HTML, CSS, and JS CI/CD to AWS CodePipeline from this GitHub to an S3 bucket.
######
###### I connected this GitHub repo to CodePipeline by following the prompts and linking through the GUI in AWS.
###### I then created a blanket folder deployment from this repo to an S3 bucket.
###### The bucket is distributed through CloudFront and a statically hosted S3 website endpoint.
