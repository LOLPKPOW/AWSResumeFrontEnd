                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I began my IT journey in 2019, when family dynamics drove me to change careers from high-end Chef to a more family friendly career.
                   I quit my job and worked graveyard shifts while enrolling in my local Community college. I worked overnights while studying. I've continued to keep that drive for knowledge and career growth.
                   I've finished my Bachelor's Degree in Cloud Computing, and have completed 10 certifications.
