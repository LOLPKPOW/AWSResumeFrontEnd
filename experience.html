                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I began my IT journey in 2019, when family dynamics drove me to change careers from high-end Chef to a more family friendly career.
                   I quit my job and worked graveyard shifts while enrolling in my local Community college. I worked overnights while studying. I've continued to keep that drive for knowledge and career growth.
                   I've finished my Bachelor's Degree in Cloud Computing, and have completed 10 certifications.

                <p>Feel free to check out my GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/LOLPKPOW/">https://github.com/LOLPKPOW/</a></p>
                <p>My GitHub has some CloudFormation Templates, a SAM template, and a script I built for O365 common functions that require Powershell. They're mostly still a work in progress.</p>

                <h2><u>AWS Projects</u></h2>
                <p>This website is hosted in an S3 bucket with a CloudFront distribution. The code is managed in my GitHub, using a CodePipeline to update the data in the bucket. 
                The pipeline automatically deploys the code and invalidates the CloudFront distribution so updates happen immediately. The visitor counter was deploying using SAM. It deployed the DynamoDB database,
                the Lambda function, and the API Gateway. Code can be updated through the backend CodePipeline by updating the CloudFormation stack.</p>
                <p>I also have a little expense tracker webapp I created for my wife and I at <a href="https://expenses.pwoodward.info">https://expenses.pwoodward.info</a>. It's not particularly secure for ease of access for my wife :)</p>
